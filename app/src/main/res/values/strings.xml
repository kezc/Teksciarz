Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Phone ringin', never outgoin', homebody
Never outgoin', put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish addin' notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up, you should set it off
Tell me “Time's up,” let the water run, let my body run

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die durin' sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimmin'
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Pick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleepin' with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinkin' deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
They said “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Bridge: Joba &amp; Kevin Abstract]
Everything I have (Is a mirror)
And everywhere I stand (Isn't solid ground)
People don't make sense (To me anymore)
I'm hiding out, again, tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out, uh
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky

[Outro: bearface &amp; Ryan Beatty]
Everything you wear, I'll be the one to care
Softly, you braid your hair, all the angels stare, yeah
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)</string>
